However, in order\nto use d3's hierarchical properties, we need to parse this text into an\nobject with a JSON-like structure.\nWe define an \"empty\" root node for the Dendrogram, and then recursively\ntraverse the text file, searching for children and adding them to the\nstructure.\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n
